## Description

    This project is a simple companion app with only what you need to know about plants you can grow.

    Motivation:
    we don’t know how to garden. Existing resources are intimidatingly over-detailed and don’t have social feedback.

    As a user I want to:
    find plants I can grow depending on the season and level of maintenance required.
